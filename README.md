This repository contains a collection of AppleScripts that I use to trigger and enhance workflows in the Alfred app on my Mac. These scripts automate common tasks, control system settings, and streamline interactions with apps like Spotify, Apple Music, and more.

# ðŸš€ Usage

Each script in this repository is designed to be integrated with Alfred workflows. To use a script:

	1.	Open Alfred Preferences â†’ Workflows.
	2.	Add a Run Script action and select /usr/bin/osascript as the interpreter.
	3.	Copy the relevant AppleScript into the script editor.
	4.	Connect it to a hotkey, keyword, or another Alfred trigger.
